Keep challenging myself and make experience.
These words are keyword for introducing myself.
In fact I want to experience bigger world than Korea 
Of cousrse,It's not easy for me and future company.
However I'm certain that I would make a good result.
Moreover, I always enjoy challenging new people, job and task.
So If I have a chance of working in America as a software developer or mobile developer , I would do my best( even Interview )
